Avanade introduces ARA - a metadata-driven data platform accelerator based on Databricks. This tool empowers organizations to swiftly establish and expand Azure-centric data platforms. With ARA, navigating intricate data engineering tasks becomes intuitive, making data analytics aspirations a tangible reality.

Ara YAML Assistant is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the experience of working with YAML configuration files in the Ara data pipeline. It provides context-aware auto-completion, syntax validation, and other helpful features to streamline the development process.

## Features

- **Context-Aware Auto-Completion**: Intelligent suggestions based on the structure and context of your YAML files, including support for custom directives and properties.
